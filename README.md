# PI3NN-CNN: Out-of-distribution-aware prediction intervals from three neural networks --- using CNN for image-based data
<br/>

This is the development branch for PI3NN-CNN. We use the vanilla CNN network as the encoder to extract the spatial information from image-based, then we train PI3NN-MLP networks for UQ based on the intermediate predictions from the CNN encoder.
